- More preparations for Qt5 configure build.

- Primeval support for MIDI RPN/NRPN 14-bit controllers input.

- Fixed an incremental value stickiness, which were affecting
  some parameters step changes from up/down spin-box widgets
  (eg. Master Tune).

  compliant with the ISO standard where middle C (60) is now C4
  (was C3).

  into regular asynchronous signal/slot strategy.

- General standard dialog buttons layout is now in place.


0.1.0  2010-04-21  Second public release.

- Initial widget geometry and visibility persistence logic has
  been slightly revised as much to avoid crash failures due to
  wrong main widget hidden state.

- General source tree layout and build configuration change.

- Make build compilation work for gcc >= 4.4.0, by adding some
  missing standard C99 includes.

- LADISH Level 1 support has been added: SIGUSR1 signal trap
